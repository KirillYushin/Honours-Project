Investigating the use of Deep Q-Learning in teaching a Neural Network to drive

My goal with this project was to research and learn about reinforcement learning and state-of-the art techniques used to make it so powerful. 
I created a simulation environment in the form of a racing game and a Neural Network that I attempted to teach to drive using Deep Q-Learning algorithm. 
I implemented several powerful improvements for the regular Deep Q-Learning algorithm that allowed me to create an impressive neural network that outperforms any human that tried to play my racing game.
